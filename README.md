### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emmanuel, a developer found of programming and of automation in general. 

I'm currently a PhD student at Inria's [DiverSE team](https://www.diverse-team.fr). I work on the topic of Language Engineering; more specifically I experiment with new ways of making programming languages modular in the aim of making easier to create new languages and to evolve existing ones. Catchy, isn't it? :smile:

I contribute to open-source projects as much as possible but sadly I haven't had much free time lately.

## Contributions

I actively contribute to the following projects:

 - [Pitclipse](https://github.com/pitest/pitclipse) is an plug-in for the Eclipse IDE allowing to perform mutation testing on your Java projects. Is is based on [PIT (Pitest)](http://pitest.org). 
 - [ALE (Action Language for EMF](https://github.com/gemoc/ale-lang) is an interpreted action language allowing to define behaviors on top of Ecore models and making them executable right away.

## Personal projects

I created the following projects:

 - [Discord's Rich Presence for Eclipse IDE](https://github.com/echebbi/eclipse-discord-integration) is an Eclipse IDE plug-in that updates your Discord's status with the name of the files you're working on. The information shown and the wording are highly customizable.
 - [EKumi](https://github.com/echebbi/ekumi) is a proof-of-concept to experiment with modular and polyglot workflow management systems (WfMS). It is provided as a set of plug-ins for the Eclipse IDE.

### About me

I'm Emmanuel, I build software with a strong focus on maintainability and developer experience.

I’m particularly interested in building tools that improve collaboration and knowledge sharing in complex technical environments. My most recent large project was a collaboration platform for engineering; it was aimed at bringing practices like DevOps and CI/CD into systems engineering workflows.

My professional background spans 10 years of industrial experience, academic work at Inria's [DiverSE team](https://www.diverse-team.fr) and entrepreneurship.

## Contributions

I used to actively contribute to the following projects:

 - The Engineering Forge (will be open-sourced soon) is the research prototype of a multi-disciplinary collaboration platform that explored how to bring the best of software collaboration practices (DevOps, CI/CD, ...) to systems engineering.
 - [Pitclipse](https://github.com/pitest/pitclipse) is an Eclipse IDE plug-in enabling mutation testing on your Java projects. Is is based on [PIT (Pitest)](http://pitest.org). 
 - [ALE (Action Language for EMF)](https://github.com/gemoc/ale-lang) is an interpreted action language allowing to define behaviors on top of Ecore models and making them executable right away.

## Personal projects

I created the following projects:

 - [Discord's Rich Presence for Eclipse IDE](https://github.com/echebbi/eclipse-discord-integration) is an Eclipse IDE plug-in that updates your Discord's status with the name of the files you're working on. The information shown and the wording are highly customizable.
 - [EKumi](https://github.com/echebbi/ekumi) is a proof-of-concept to experiment with modular and polyglot workflow management systems (WfMS). It is provided as a set of plug-ins for the Eclipse IDE.

## Technical stack

- **Primary**: Java (backend & tooling), Python (automation)
- **Experienced with**: C++, Bash, SQL
- **Backend**: Quarkus, Neo4J
- **Modularity & platforms**: OSGi, Eclipse RCP
- **Model-driven engineering**: Eclipse EMF, Xtext, Gemoc
- **Tooling**: Git, Docker, Maven

I am also creating a game with a friend using Unreal Engine 4/5, gaining experience in C++ game development and project management.
